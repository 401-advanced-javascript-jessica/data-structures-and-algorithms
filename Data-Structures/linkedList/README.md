## Singly Linked List
A linked list is a data structure that is composed of nodes.  The list iteself is just a reference to the first node in the list. 

### Challenge
* The challenge was to build linked list and it's basic methods
* The second challenge was to build the method appendToTail
* The third challenge was to build getFromEnd(k)
### Approach & Efficiency
insertAtHead() - O(k)
includes(value) - O(N)
traverse() - O(N)
toString() - O(N)
remove() - O(k)
appendToTail() - O(N)
getFromEnd(k) - O(2N)
